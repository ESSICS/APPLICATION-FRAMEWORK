		<p>Allows dragging the visible plot area along the X axis only, the Y
			axis only, or freely, changing the visible axis range.</p>
		<p>If the movement is not constrained on one axis, then pressing SHIFT
			when panning will restrict the movement to X or Y axis only
			according to the direction of the initial movement of the gesture.</p>
		<p>Scroll can be performed with a track-pad or a mouse wheel. SHIFT will
			lock the scroll on the prominent axis, while SHORTCUT (COMMAND on
			macOS, CTRL on Windows and Linux) will swap the axis (so with a
			mouse wheel will be possible to scroll on both axis).</p>
