        <title>XAOS Gauge API Specification</title>
    </head>
    
    <body>

        <p>
            XAOS (ΧΑΟΣ – the primordial state of existence) is a JavaFX 
			application framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            The framework was initially conceived to create accelerator physics
            applications based on <a href="https://github.com/openxal/openxal" target="_blank"><em>Open XAL</em></a>,
            an open source development environment used for creating accelerator
            physics applications, scripts and services.
        </p>
		<p>
			The framework is compose by a series modules: the <i>XAOS Gauge</i>
			module provides the JavaFX-based kit of controls and tools for
			creating gauges.
		</p>
        <p>
            The project is hosted in the <a href="https://github.com/ESSICS/XAOS" target="_blank"><em>XAOS</em></a>
            GitHub repository.
