        <p>
            XAOS (ΧΑΟΣ – the primordial state of existence) is a JavaFX
			application framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            The framework was initially conceived to create accelerator physics
            applications based on <a href="https://github.com/openxal/openxal" target="_blank"><em>Open XAL</em></a>,
            an open source development environment used for creating accelerator
            physics applications, scripts and services.
        </p>
        <p>
			The framework is compose by a series modules: the <i>XAOS App Preloader</i>
			module provides the preloader (i.e. splash-screen) part of the
			application framework for building UI-based applications. The module
			is separated from the <i>xaos.app</i> to provide a faster JAR file
			to be loaded as first one in the application run-time life-cycle.
        </p>
