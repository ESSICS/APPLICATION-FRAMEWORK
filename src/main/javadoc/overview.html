        <p>
            A JavaFX application framework based on 
            <a href="http://jacpfx.org" target="_blank"><em>JacpFX</em></a>
            (Java Asynchronous Client Platform).
        </p>
        <p>
            The framework was initially conceived to create accelerator physics
            applications based on <a href="https://github.com/openxal/openxal" target="_blank"><em>Open XAL</em></a>,
            an open source development environment used for creating accelerator
            physics applications, scripts and services.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project is hosted in the <a href="https://github.com/ESSICS/APPLICATION-FRAMEWORK" target="_blank"><em>APPLICATION-FRAMEWORK</em></a>
            GitHub repository.
        </p>

        <h2>Application Layout</h2>

        <p>
            The framework will allow applications having a generic layout with
            the following components:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A toolbar in the top area, with 3 groups of buttons:
                <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                    <li>On the left, the buttons controlling the display of the left and bottom views;</li>
                    <li>On the right, the button controlling the display of the right view;</li>
                    <li>On the center, application specific buttons.</li>
                </ul>
                If the application will not use outer views, the corresponding
                buttons will not be displayed. Moreover, if no application
                specific buttons are added, the whole toolbar will not be
                displayed.
            </li>
            <li>
                A status bar in the bottom area, where status message and other
                informations are displayed. The status bar can be omitted it the
                application doesn't need it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Peripheral views (<i>browser</i>, <i>navigator/overview</i>,
                <i>console/messages</i>, <i>palette</i>, and <i>inspector/properties</i>),
                where the application can register content to be displayed. If
                some of the views are not used then will not be displayed. When
                displayed, the splitters will allow to resize them.
            </li>
            <li>
                The main view area used by the application to display its main
                content.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <br>
            <img src="doc-files/layout-01.png" alt="Application Layout." height="600">
            <br>
        </p>

        <h3>Outer View Areas</h3>

        <p>
            The complete application is made of 6 view areas, where the <i>main</i>
            one is always visible.
        </p>

        <p>
            A view area is visible only if at least one view is registered. The only
            exception is the <i>main</i> area, where views can be added dynamically,
            and no initial view is required.
        </p>

        <h4>Browser View Area</h4>

        <p>
            The <i>browser</i> view should be used to navigate high-level structures
            in order to find elements to be opened in dedicated views inside the
            <i>main</i> area.
        </p>
    
        <h4>Navigator/Overview View Area</h4>

        <p>
            This view area should be used to navigate the content of <i>selected</i>
            entities, or display an overview of a more detailed zone displayed in
            the currently visible <i>main</i> view.
        </p>
